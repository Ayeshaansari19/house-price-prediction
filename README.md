# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a regression-based machine learning model to predict house prices using various housing-related features. The goal is to understand the complete machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## Dataset
The dataset contains multiple features related to housing conditions such as crime rate, number of rooms, accessibility, and other location-based factors.  
Missing values were handled using mean imputation.

## Model Used
- Linear Regression

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Handled missing values  
3. Selected features and target variable  
4. Split data into training and testing sets  
5. Trained a regression model  
6. Evaluated the model using performance metrics  

## Model Evaluation
The model was evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

These metrics were used to measure prediction accuracy and model reliability.

## Conclusion
The regression model successfully predicts house prices with reasonable accuracy and demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for real-world data analysis problems.
